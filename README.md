Crystalline Advent of Code 2021
===============================

I've been working in Ruby (on Rails) daily for >10 years now, and I love its ergonomics and productivity. No one would accuse Ruby of being an especially fast language, though, and deploying Rails applications has never been especially convenient. For these and other reasons, I want to add to my toolkit a **fast** language with:

* static typing
* self-contained web app deployment
* macros, because they're supposed to be A Big Deal
* understandable, fast, and safe concurrency
* ideally, a syntax, paradigm, and culture I like working with

So I'm trying [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org), and using Advent of Code 2021 as the medium.
